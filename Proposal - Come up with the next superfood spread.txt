Proposal writing - Come up with the next super food spread. 

When most people think of spreads they think of unhealthy, buttery products that are smeared across toast and muffins or used to top vegetables. Today’s smarter consumers are starting to choose foods that do good for their body. A new market for better, more interesting and healthier spreads has been born… for example, those made with beneficial oils and ingredients. 

Avocados, hummus, nut butters, coconut butters, and other new spreads aren’t just being eaten with boring bread products, but are accompanying vegetables, pita bread, pretzels and more. We make spreads and want to know what you think the next best one will be. 


Deliverables 

Answer each item separately in your proposal for the next Super Spread: 
1. What is your Super Spread idea? 
2. Why do you think it will be popular in today’s market? 
3. How would you package your Super Spread? 
4. At what location(s) (specific chains or types of location) would your spread sell best? 


Things to consider: 

- A Super Spread should be a “Superfood”. This means it should help people feel better, perform better, live better, and definitely not be empty calories. 
- A Super Spread should not only taste good and be healthy for you, but should also be healthy for the planet too. 
- A Super Spread should be affordable enough that people can enjoy it every day. 
- You can propose a line of different Super Spreads but no more than 3 or 4 products.
